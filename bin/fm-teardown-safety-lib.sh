#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-teardown-safety-lib.sh - the single owner of firstmate's unlanded-work test.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Hard rule 3 says unlanded work is never torn down, and this
# test is what enforces it. It used to live inline in bin/fm-teardown.sh, whose
# only caller was a task teardown. bin/fm-pool-reap.sh then needed exactly the
# same verdict for a POOLED COPY THAT NO TASK OWNS, and a reaper that carries its
# own, second, inevitably weaker copy of "has this work landed?" is precisely the
# shape of tool that destroys work by accident. So the test moved here unchanged
# and both callers share it. Nothing about the checks themselves changed in the
# move: bin/fm-teardown.sh sources this file and calls the same functions with
# the same globals it always did.
#
# THE CONTRACT. validate_worktree_teardown_safety() reads its inputs from the
# caller's globals, which is how it worked inline and is preserved deliberately
# so the move stayed behaviour-for-behaviour identical:
#
#   WT       the worktree under test. A missing directory passes (nothing to lose).
#   PROJ     the backing project checkout, used to resolve the default branch.
#   MODE     the delivery mode; local-only additionally accepts work already
#            merged into the LOCAL default branch, because such a project may
#            have no remote at all.
#   KIND     ship (or empty) gets the full test. secondmate and scout carve out,
#            because their completion gates live elsewhere - bin/fm-pool-reap.sh
#            therefore passes an EMPTY kind so no carve-out can apply to a copy
#            whose provenance it cannot know.
#   FORCE    "--force" skips the test entirely. Only a caller that holds the
#            captain's explicit authority to discard may set it; the reaper never
#            sets it and has no flag that could.
#   PR_URL   the task's recorded PR, when it has one. Empty is fine: the PR is
#            then resolved from the branch name instead.
#
# Returns 0 when the worktree holds nothing unlanded, 1 on a refusal (with the
# reason on stderr), and $TEARDOWN_WORKTREE_SAFETY_LOCK_BLOCKED when a git lock
# made the inspection itself impossible - never a guess in either direction.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS LANDED. Work has landed when it is reachable from any
# remote-tracking branch (a fork counts, so upstream-contribution PRs pushed to a
# fork satisfy this in any mode), OR when its PR is merged and GitHub reports a
# PR head containing the current local work, OR when its content is already
# present in the up-to-date default branch. That last case is what recognizes the
# common squash-merge-then-delete-branch flow, where the branch's own commits
# live nowhere on a remote yet the change is fully in main. A gh lookup error
# falls back to the content check; if that is also inconclusive the test refuses
# rather than risk discarding unlanded work. Uncommitted changes are never
# landed.
#
# The dirty check exempts firstmate's own per-task pointers, and nothing else.
# Only exact filenames firstmate writes are named, never a directory, so a file
# an agent authored beside one still counts as work; and the exemption is
# anchored to git-porcelain's UNTRACKED marker, so a project that TRACKS one of
# those paths keeps its own file protected. Claude's hooks are not among them:
# they no longer live in the worktree at all. That is also why the captain's
# 2026-08-11 authority to discard a lone .claude/settings.local.json is not
# expressed here as an exemption - teardown removes an untracked legacy file at
# the old path outright, and a caller that does not do that removal simply sees
# the file as ordinary untracked content and refuses. Callers must not widen this.
#
# Sourced, never executed. bin/fm-lock-lib.sh must already be sourced by the
# caller for the git-lock staleness proof.

# WT, PROJ, MODE, KIND, FORCE and PR_URL are the caller's inputs described above,
# so shellcheck cannot see them assigned in this file. That is the contract, not
# an oversight.
